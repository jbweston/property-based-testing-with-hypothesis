# Property-based testing with Hypothesis
[![license: CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png)][cc-by-sa]

This is a presentation that I'm going to give at some point about property-based testing
and the success I've had with the [Hypothesis][hypothesis] library.

## Building the presentation

The presentation is built using [pandoc][pandoc]. If you have `pandoc`, `wget` and `make` installed
you can simply say:

```
make
```

This downloads `reveal.js` and builds a standalone HTML presentation, `presentation.html`.
